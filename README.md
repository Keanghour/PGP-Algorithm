# PGP-Algorithm
Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a widely-used encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. Initially created by Phil Zimmermann in 1991, it uses a combination of asymmetric (public-key) and symmetric (private-key) cryptography to secure sensitive information.
